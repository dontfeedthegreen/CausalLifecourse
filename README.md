# CausalLifecourse
Template R code for estimating causal effects from lifecourse data (assuming no unmeasured confounding).
Specifically, this is designed for situations where you have:
repeated measures of exposure and an outcome occuring later

Currently based on having access to a data file that I'm using locally.
You would need to replace with your own data file and edit variable names etc accordingly.
I hope to update later with some test data that will be downloadable.

Suggestions for refining the syntax are very welcome.
If you use it, a citation/acknowledgement would be nice! 

The R file is the code, the PDF is the poster I created for SER2019 using the code.
